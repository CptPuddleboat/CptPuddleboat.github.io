											<h2>Creator of many things</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Currently a final year student at Staffordshire University for the BSc (Hons) Computer Games Design and Programming course. 
										Largely inspired by the media I consume and the content creators I follow, my work focuses primarily on the inception and design 
										of fun and novel ideas. The experiences and knowledge gained through my time at university have broadened my horizons, and 
										culminated in an array of impressive projects, but with industry experience, I hope to further expand my capabilities.</p>

										<h3>Troubled Waters (2021)</h3>
										<p>A game built as bart of Ukie's Mobo Jam, the theme was given as 'water', with the intention being to raise awareness for charities supporting communities without access to clean water. It was built over 2 days as part of a two-person team.</p>

										<h3>Modding 'Nox' (2020/2021)</h3>
										<p>As part of my university degree, I had to create a mod for a high-complexity system built by a lecturer, named 'Nox'. This was a great exercise and experience in working within a large codebase that was not wholly my own.</p>

										<h3>Wyndrider's Guide to Bravestar(2020/2021)</h3>
										<p>One of my favourite hobbies is tabletop roleplaying, particularly within D&D 5e, and as a games designer, there is no better outlet for inspiration. As my final year project, I designed and wrote an entire book for the system.</p>

										<h3>Queer Encounters (2020)</h3>
										<p>Another game jam game, this time for Ukie's Raise The Game Jam. The theme given for this jam was accessibility, and we were tasked with creating a game anyone could play. As such, we created a voice-acted text-based game with only one button.</p>

										<h3>Mouse of Cards (2019/2020)</h3>
										<p>Created entirely on my own as one of my first large-scale projects in Unity, this is one of my favourite projects. It stands as a reminder of just how far my skills have come, while still being fun and charming in its own right.</p>

										<h3>No Reverse (2019/2020)</h3>
										<p>A project, similar to Mouse of Cards, being a standing example of my early work in Unreal. It is my only experiment to feature a multiplayer focus, and is one of the most technically complex Unreal projects I personally created.</p>

										<h3>Modeling Projects (2019/2020)</h3>
										<p>As a module of my degree, I was given the task of replicating the style of a popular game, recreating a high-poly industry-standard model, and creating a low-poly character model, all of which gave me insight to a new facet of game development.</p>

										<h3>Shield Field (2019)</h3>
										<p>My first game prototype built in Unreal, this was a puzzle game that I built using its blueprint system. My favourite part of designing this game was exploring the level design, as it echoed my favourite games, like Portal.</p>

										<h3>CTF_Lazdrill (2018)</h3>
										<p>As one of the first things I made at university, this was a map created for Unreal Tournament. I am still very happy with the final product, and it is still something I'm proud of, standing as an early marker in my career.</p>
